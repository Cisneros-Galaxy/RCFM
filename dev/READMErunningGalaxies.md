# Editing Neros file (functions)

 

## (1) Manually

write your own function and get somebody to check it, then add it to the list of existing functions

## (2) use functions already established

hack the existing code

# Running the code

1. Open Anaconda
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
3. Navigate to where the code is located
4. Click on the model.ipynb file
5. hit "run-all" or clear the cashe and run. 
6. record resulting table values
7. plot alpha correlation function

# Contributing

1. Got something really good? [criteria: functions which have good chisquare (<4), coefficients a & b (0.6-0.8), correlation fcn]
