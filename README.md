# Installing Dependancies

Before running anything, you need to install all of the dependencies. There are two ways to do this (do only one or the other):

## (1) Manually

[Install Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
 [Install Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)  
 [Install MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html)

## (2) With Anaconda - RECOMMENDED

Anaconda is a platform that makes it super easy to work with Python and Notebook. It comes with all the dependencies already installed! Just open it up, click "Launch" under "Jupyter Notebook" then navigate to the project's folder.  
 [Install Anaconda Python 3.6 Version](https://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html)
